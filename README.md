# ClothX (Athena Hack 2021)

### A group project for the April 2021 Athena Hackathon, presenting ideas for the Circular Economy.

- Jude Boyd - Technical Writer & Researcher
- Emma Smith & Jamie Hammond - Front-end
- Debbie Urquhart & Anna Henderson - Back-end

We researched the circular economy and saw the statistics about how much clothing that goes to landfill each year in the UK, We wanted to radically improve recycling of textiles. Much of our inspiration came from The Ellen MacArthur Foundation. We decided to create an app to address to help reduce the amount of clothes being put to landfill. We wanted the app to be a real shopping experience even though no money would be changing hands and the clothes would not be new. We also wanted to reduce the stigma of people wearing 'hand me down' clothes. We thought the app could also benefit parents of school age children with regards to school uniforms which are costly. We had a vision of whole school communities using the app. We designed the app to be user friendly and uncomplicated. This app will also promote the circular economy and educate people about it.
